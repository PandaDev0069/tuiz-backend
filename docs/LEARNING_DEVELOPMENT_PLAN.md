## Learning Methodology

### ðŸŽ“ **Learning by Doing**

1. **Start with working examples** - I'll provide complete, working code
2. **Modify incrementally** - Change small parts to understand how they work
3. **Build on success** - Each day builds on what you learned the previous day
4. **Ask questions** - Don't hesitate to ask "why" and "how"

### ðŸ“– **Code Reading Strategy**

1. **Read the code first** - Understand what it does
2. **Trace the flow** - Follow data from input to output
3. **Identify patterns** - Look for repeated structures
4. **Experiment** - Try changing values and see what happens

### ðŸ”§ **Hands-on Practice**

1. **Type the code yourself** - Don't just copy-paste
2. **Add comments** - Explain what each part does
3. **Break things intentionally** - See what happens when you make mistakes
4. **Fix your mistakes** - Learn from debugging

## Daily Learning Routine

### **Morning (1-2 hours)**

- Read through the code examples I provide
- Ask questions about anything unclear

### **Afternoon (2-3 hours)**

- Implement the day's tasks with my guidance
- Practice typing and modifying code
- Debug any issues that arise

### **Evening (30 minutes)**

- Review what you learned
- Note down questions for the next day
